Twitter and Yik Yak combined: Inform users of important notice of events immediately by subscribing to a selected region.

Users can freely upload pictures or a very short text and broadcast to both everyone within the radius of 3.14 km, and anyone who subscribed to that region. If users find any contributions violating the terms and conditions, such as but not limited to unauthorized advertising, spam or inappropriate content, the post may be flagged to be removed.

Planned to be built on iOS.
